# Dropchess

Ever wondered what it would be like if you combined the rules of chess with the rules of Rocket League's [Dropshot](https://rocketleague.fandom.com/wiki/Dropshot)? Probably not, but I did.

The game is hosted [here](https://danprince.github.io/dropchess/) but there's no CPU opponent, so you'll have to play against yourself, or play couch co-op style.

There's also a free-for-all multiplayer version [here](https://danprince.github.io/dropchess/multiplayer.html) but I don't guarantee that this will stay online.

Add something like `#woopdeedoo` to the multiplayer URL to play in a dedicated room.
